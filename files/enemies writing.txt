BOMB
+Your bomb ignites the archer's tower. He is crushed under the collapsing wood and rubble.
+Having little protection against the burning oil, they fall to the ground in a heap of flames. Ouch.
-The knight's armour is much too thick to be penetrated by your bomb. She grabs you by the head and chucks you at the ground. You die of your wounds.
-They gracefully dodge your bomb and throw back one of their own. The pain of the fire is unbearable. The scoundrel hits the griddy over your burnt corpse.
+The engineer watches in horror as his many structures fall to rubble before him. He dies of shock before you can get a hit in.
-He deflects the bomb, using his maul like a pre-industrial revolution baseball bat. It hits you square in the face and explodes all over you. You are killed.

ARROW
-As you ready your bow you hear a "THUNK". Looking down, you see the arrow stuck in your chest. The enemy archer was faster than you. You fall to the ground.
-The footman's spear is just long enough to reach you. before you can release your arrow, you receive an impromptu transorbital lobotomy, courtesy of the young soldier.
+The veteran's armour is thick, but somehow your arrow finds a way. It lodges itself right in her neck, and she falls down, dead.
-The scoundrel bends backwards to dodge your arrow, Matrix-style. You're so distracted by their awesomeness, you don't even notice the sword being flung at your face.
+He thinks he is fast with his ballista cannon, but you are faster. You shoot him directly in the face. He dies.
-The arrow just barely misses him, and he launches a swift counter attack. I think he's using gameshark. Either way though, he kills you.

SWORD
-He is literally like a hundred metres away. What the hell is a sword gonna do? He shoots you down and honestly? You deserve it. Dumbass.
+You thrust your sword into their chest. Their armour is weak, and you wound them greatly. They fall down dead.
-Your sword makes a "CLANG" noise as it hits off the warrior's thick armour. Unfazed, she counter-attacks, launching her mace into your chest. You are very dead.
+He's got a slightly smaller sword, which means you win! Not exactly sure how that works, to be honest. Anyway, he dies.
-'Your puny sword is no match for science!' the engineer cries out. He chucks you in the meat grinder and your meat is ground up and it is disgusting.
-You swing at him, but you didn't expect him to pull out the 360 cucumber jpeg wessex watterfall WT drag! Your death is as instant as it is disorientating to watch.

HAMMER
-You swing wildly at the air around you. He obviously isn't harmed because a hammer is useless at that range. You are shot down swiftly. Later that day he tells his friends of your stupidity and they all laugh.
-Your hammer is outranged by the footman's spear. They turn you into a shish kebab with great might and efficiency.
+You whack her across the head with your warhammer, and she cries out in pain. It's hard to tell under the helmet, but you probably just gave her massive internal bleeding. Yeah, she's gonna be dead pretty soon.
-They expertly parry your attack, yoink your hammer, and smack you with your own weapon. He then takes the L on your dead body.
+Using your hammer, you piece together five of the engineer's buildings into one huge robot. A bit derivative, but that's ok. You crush him into a fine paste nonetheless.
-His hammer is much bigger than yours, and it makes you insecure. Your opponent takes advantage of this and slams you with his maul.

SECRET
+I KNEW IT! I KNEW HE WAS HACKING! The moderators ban the warrior's account for a million days.
