"archer","The huntsman sits perched atop a tower.","-He shows no mercy; his arrow lodges itself in your head, killing you instantly.","+Your bomb ignites the archer's tower. He is crushed under the collapsing wood and rubble.","-As you ready your bow you hear a 'THUNK'. Looking down, you see the arrow stuck in your chest. The enemy archer was faster than you. You fall to the ground.","-He is literally like a hundred metres away. What the hell is a sword gonna do? He shoots you down and honestly? You deserve it. Dumbass.","-You swing wildly at the air around you. He obviously isn't harmed because a hammer is useless at that range. You are shot down swiftly. Later that day he tells his friends of your stupidity and they all laugh.",
"footman","The soldier clutches a spear tightly in their hand.","-They do not accept your surrender. They thrust their spear through your heart, killing you instantly.","+Having little protection against the burning oil, they fall to the ground in a heap of flames. Ouch.","-The footman's spear is just long enough to reach you. before you can release your arrow, you receive an impromptu transorbital lobotomy, courtesy of the young soldier.","+You thrust your sword into their chest. Their armour is weak, and you wound them greatly. They fall down dead.","-Your hammer is outranged by the footman's spear. They turn you into a shish kebab with great might and efficiency.",
"veteran","The armoured knight towers over you.","-The knight scoffs; she has no time for mercy. Mace in hand, she crushes your skull, killing you instantly.","-The knight's armour is much too thick to be penetrated by your bomb. She grabs you by the head and chucks you at the ground. You die of your wounds.","+The veteran's armour is thick, but somehow your arrow finds a way. It lodges itself right in her neck, and she falls down, dead.","-Your sword makes a 'CLANG' noise as it hits off the warrior's thick armour. Unfazed, she counter-attacks, launching her mace into your chest. You are very dead.","+You whack her across the head with your warhammer, and she cries out in pain. It's hard to tell under the helmet, but you probably just gave her massive internal bleeding. Yeah, she's gonna be dead pretty soon.",
"scoundrel","The lowly jester taunts you.","-They accept, and urge you to flee. While your back is turned, though, they launch a bomb in your direction. Your death is instant.","-They gracefully dodge your bomb and throw back one of their own. The pain of the fire is unbearable. The scoundrel hits the griddy over your burnt corpse.","-The scoundrel bends backwards to dodge your arrow, Matrix-style. You're so distracted by their awesomeness, you don't even notice the sword being flung at your face.","+They've got a slightly smaller sword, which means you win! Not exactly sure how that works, to be honest. Anyway, they die.","-They expertly parry your attack, yoink your hammer, and smack you with your own weapon. They then take the L on your dead body.",
"engineer","The methodical builder fortifies his defenses.","-He accepts your surrender and lowers his weapon. A loose brick from one of his contraptions slips and falls on your head. You die instantly.","+The engineer watches in horror as his many structures fall to rubble before him. He dies of shock before you can get a hit in.","+He thinks he is fast with his ballista cannon, but you are faster. You shoot him directly in the face. He dies.","-'Your puny sword is no match for science!' the engineer cries out. He chucks you in the meat grinder and your meat is ground up and it is disgusting.","+Using your hammer, you piece together five of the engineer's buildings into one huge robot. A bit derivative, but that's ok. You crush him into a fine paste nonetheless.",
"naked maul man","At a measly 4ft tall, the short-stacked hammer wielder doesn't seem much of a threat.","-Big mistake. He knows not the concept of mercy, and kills you with his hammer quite brutally. And instantly.","-He deflects the bomb, using his maul like a pre-industrial revolution baseball bat. It hits you square in the face and explodes all over you. You are killed.","-The arrow just barely misses him, and he launches a swift counter attack. I think he's using gameshark. Either way though, he kills you.","-You swing at him, but you didn't expect him to pull out the 360 cucumber jpeg wessex watterfall WT drag! Your death is as instant as it is disorientating to watch.","-His hammer is much bigger than yours, and it makes you insecure. Your opponent takes advantage of this and slams you with his maul.","+I KNEW IT! I KNEW HE WAS HACKING! The moderators ban the warrior's account for a million days."
